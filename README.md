# üìÅ SPH5104 Group 2: HbA1c and Mortality in ICU Patients with MI

This repository contains all SQL, R scripts, and outputs used for the analysis of the impact of HbA1c on inpatient and 1-year mortality among ICU patients with myocardial infarction (MI), as part of the coursework for **SPH5104: Health Data Analytics**.

## üìä Outcomes Assessed

1. **In-hospital mortality**: Time from hospital admission to in-hospital death or discharge.
2. **1-year mortality**: Time from hospital admission to all-cause death, with right-censoring at 365 days.

## üß™ Methods Summary

- **Data Source**: MIMIC-IV v3.1  
- **Population**: ICU patients with MI, with HbA1c recorded within ¬±3 months of ICU admission.  
- **Statistical Methods**:
  - Descriptive statistics (ANOVA, chi-square tests)
  - Logistic regression
  - Propensity score matching (MatchIt)
  - Kaplan-Meier estimation + log-rank test
  - Cox proportional hazards model

## üìå Notes

- 38% of cases were excluded from PSM due to missing covariate data.
- Survival analysis begins from **hospital admission**, not discharge or ICU admission.
- Time-to-event variables are cleaned to ensure non-negative durations.
